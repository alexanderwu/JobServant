  * Research and develop algorithms to model real-world systems and behavior based on actual observations
  * Conceive of, and implement, experiments to test hypotheses regarding (statistical) behavior of data and algorithms
  * Translate product management, engineering, and business constraints/queries into tractable data science questions
  * Work cross-functionally with software engineers to integrate data science models into production pipelines
  * Help develop, improve, and evangelize our data science knowledge base and infrastructure
  * Iterate rapidly on everything; all of the above happens in a relatively fast paced business driven environment, and you must be comfortable with that

Qualifications

  * US Citizen required (clearance eligible)
  * Masters degree in a STEM field (e.g., statistics, machine learning, computer science, physics, engineering)
  * An ability to communicate complex data science concepts and results in a readily-understood manner
  * Two years of demonstrable experience working with large and noisy datasets, and particular experience with datasets that have nevertheless have sparsity in some dimension (e.g., spatially, temporally) would be a big plus
  * Demonstrable experience implementing efficient data science models and deploying them in a production environment
  * Excellent coding skills (python with a solid familiarity with NumPy, SciPy, pandas strongly preferred)
  * Experience with git, GitHub, SQL, AWS (S3 and EC2), Docker, and Unix/Linux a big plus

Orbital Insight is a fast growing provider of geospatial data and geo­-analytic services to commercial, nonprofit and public sector clients across the globe. Leveraging advancements in computer vision and cloud computing, Orbital Insight is turning millions of images into a big picture understanding of the world that is quantitatively grounded in observation, creating unprecedented transparency, and empowering global decision makers with new sources of objective, quantified socio­-economic insights.

By harnessing science, medicine, and machine learning, our technology discovers how diabetes affects people differently and provides specific recommendations to move them to a healthier state.

While multiple technology solutions have appeared in the last decade to address diabetes, innovation has been marginal, making the sector ripe for disruption. We're leveraging dense data from wearables, smartphones, and digital health; and developed an ontology of 16M food items alongside algorithms like anti-cheat food detection, food recommendations for glycemic load, and 33-hour glucose curve predictions. We also employ social and gamification strategies to keep users engaged with their health and motivated to level up. Together, these tools power our lifestyle intervention programs for improved glucose regulation and metabolic health.

There's a 1% chance an earthquake will cause $50 billion of insured loss within the next 12 months and a 5% chance that a hurricane will cause $60 billion of insured losses next year. At RMS, we turn risks into real numbers. How? By building simulation models that allow insurers and investors to understand and manage their global risks--from hurricanes, quakes, and wildfires, to cyber attacks, terror attacks, and pandemics. Why? We want to build a more resilient world, and we're on a mission to help make every risk known.

Insurers, reinsurers, investors, financial institutions, governments, and NGOs trust RMS solutions to better understand and manage catastrophe risks. RMS was founded in 1989 by Stanford scientists who created our first model for California Earthquake. Today, RMS has some 1,300 employees across 13 offices in the US, London, Bermuda, Zurich, India, China, Japan, Singapore, and Australia, and over 1,000 products and models now covering six continents.

RMS helped pioneer the natural catastrophe model market we now lead - and we continue to innovate.

Why Cisco

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here's how we do it.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we're ""old"" (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we're also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do - you can't put us in a box.

But ""Digital Transformation"" is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Don't care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That's cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!","* ### Seniority level

It is unlikely that our current system, bogged down by misaligned incentive structures, can be fixed in order to realize this potential. Therefore, we intend to reinvent it. The foundation of this new system will be tools that empower patients and their physicians to quantify, track, and analyze physiological changes in their bodies in unprecedented detail.

In the past decade there has been an explosion in the tools available for the measurement and quantification of biological systems. Genomics was just the beginning. We are entering the age of full-stack, multi-scale biological digitization which will include Epigenomics, Transcriptomics, Proteomics, Metabolomics, Microbioimcs, Radiomics and more. Many of the tools to quantify our biology at these different layers of biological processes are improving faster than Moore's law on a price-performance basis. We seek exceptional highly motivated individuals who want to help us build the first platform capable of aggregating and analyzing all of this information in order to dramatically improve our ability to detect and predict the onset of disease in asymptomatic individuals.

Our protocol is based on landmark systems biology research done at Stanford University . In about an hour, we take blood, saliva, urine and a non-invasive whole-body scan from which we extract 1000's of genetic, chemical, and anatomical biomarkers to build the world's most comprehensive quantitative snapshot of an individual's health at a point in time.

Q Bio was founded by Jeffrey Kaditz, serial entrepreneur and Founder of Affirm, Dr Michael Snyder, Chair of Genetics and Director of Personalized Medicine and Stanford University, and Dr Garry Choy, physician, radiologist, and former Chief Medical Information Officer at Mass General Hospital. We are fortunate to be backed by some of the best venture groups in the world including: A16Z, Khosla Ventures, Founders Fund, SciFi VC, and Kevin Durant.

Across three core Initiative focus areas of Science, Education and Justice and Opportunity, we're pairing engineering with grantmaking, impact investing, policy work, and movement building, to help build an inclusive, just and healthy future for everyone.

Our Values

We believe we can help build a future for everyone.

  * We aim to be daring, but humble: We look for bold ideas — regardless of structure and stage — and help them scale by pairing engineers with subject matter experts to build tools that accelerate the pace of social progress.
  * We want to learn fast, but build for the long-term: We want to iterate fast and help bring new solutions to the table, but we also realize that important breakthroughs often take decades, or even centuries.
  * Stay close to the real problems: We engage directly in the communities we serve because no one understands our society's challenges like those who live them every day.

Our success is dependent on building teams that include people from different backgrounds and experiences who can challenge each other's assumptions with fresh perspectives. To that end, we look for a diverse pool of applicants including those from historically marginalized groups — women, people with disabilities, people of color, formerly incarcerated people, people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and/or gender nonconforming, first and second generation immigrants, veterans, and people from different socioeconomic backgrounds.

The Opportunity

Our mission is to support science and technology that will help make it possible to cure, prevent, or manage all diseases by the end of the century. Interdisciplinary teams of physicians, biologists, computational scientists, and engineers can expand our understanding of the human body and illness — the science behind medicine.

The Science Officer will determine priorities in Computational BIology across scientific areas relevant to CZI's mission, which currently include single-cell biology, microscopy and medical imaging, metagenomics, and neurodegeneration. You will work laterally across these programs to identify computational and quantitative needs, and to implement the solutions that make them more than the sum of their parts. You will help design, review, and oversee grant-making programs with other Science Officers, providing a computational perspective based on your knowledge of modern computational and statistical methods, and an understanding of the underlying scientific areas. You will interact with external scientists, who may be grantees or collaborators, to advance program goals. In addition, you will lead and recruit a small team of computational biologists who are deeply embedded in specific program areas, provide technical leadership to them, and guide them in their hands-on work.

You will

  * Partner closely with other Science Program Officers to develop a strategy and inform grantmaking to experimental and computational scientists focusing on tools and technologies necessary to advance biomedical science and on building an interdisciplinary, collaborative community of researchers, thinking broadly across scientific areas
  * Build relationships with other groups in computational biology, including federal and international supporters, foundations, and the private sector to extend CZI's impact and reach and to share best practices, eliminate redundancy, and promote collaboration
  * Engage intellectually with the scientific community, and identify new opportunities for collaboration or grantmaking, by attending conferences, establishing working relationships with leading external scientists, and becoming a thought leader in a few areas of key scientific interest
  * Align internal work of CZI computational biologists, external grantees, and other external collaborators, emphasizing open science and rigorous computational methods
  * Build bridges by providing scientific expertise to the members of the CZI tech team who are building products, and providing computational advice and quantitative expertise to the members of the CZI science program team
  * Serve as a mentor for other computational biologists across teams to help guide them towards impactful contributions. Provide technical leadership (for example, in best practices in data infrastructure, data analysis, and open source software), and advise them in their hands-on work such as data analysis and visualization and developing collaborations with external scientists.
  * Identify growth opportunities team members and establish a collaborative, inclusive, and intellectually rigorous team culture

You have

  * 5+ years of experience in roles related to computational or quantitative biology, a PhD or an equivalent level of experience

Together with our dynamic team, the PM will shape our combined vision for the future of healthcare.  The role is based out of the Ciitizen offices in Palo Alto, California but can be 100% remote.

About Us:

Ciitizen's mission is to provide Earth's 7.3 billion citizens with control of their complete health information and give them the choice of sharing it with whomever they want. Period. With this new ownership, patients can share their health history with caregivers, share for second opinions, and with companies/researchers who may hold the answer to their treatment.

All patients have a right to all of their health information, yet existing portals pull only minimal clinical information from a fraction of health care institutions. Current ""interoperability"" initiatives leave the patient out of the picture and often rely on armies of manual labor to extract key health insights from unstructured textual data—an expensive model which doesn't scale.

In the near future, citizens will walk into a clinical facility and, with a simple tap of a mobile device, release their health information to themselves, where Ciitizen normalizes unstructured data from across the healthcare ecosystem into actionable visualizations for patients, their caregivers, and clinicians.

Ciitizen has assembled an all-star team, led by its CEO, Anil Sethi (last company was sold to Apple) and is backed by a strong investment team led by Andreessen Horowitz and general partner Vijay Pande.

Responsibilities:

  * Develop Product Roadmap aligned with company's strategic vision and direction
  * Develop product specifications, including features, user experience, acceptance criteria etc.
  * Gain a deep understanding of the patient experience, identify and fill product gaps and generate new ideas that grow market share, improve patient experience and drive growth
  * Translate product strategy and roadmap into measurable milestones
  * Work with engineering to define a predictable and reliable release schedule meeting high quality bar
  * Create a data driven decision making framework to drive product decisions 
  * Perform A/B testing to test out features with real customers
  * Collaborate with everyone in the company

Requirements:

  * The ideal candidate thrives in a fast-paced start-up environment (including dealing with ambiguity), be self-driven, and possess high integrity and accountability
  * 7+ years' experience in software product marketing; consumer/patient-facing experience a plus
  * Solid technical background with understanding and/or hands-on experience in software development processes and practices (eg. Agile)
  * Functional understanding of modern technologies like NLP, Machine Learning, Graphs, Data Security and Privacy, GDPR and Compliance etc. 
  * Must be a doer

Bonus Points:

  * Nimble and Iterative approach
  * Proven track record of managing all aspects of a successful product throughout its lifecycle
  * Excellent people and management skills to interact with colleagues and external parties
  * Strong problem solving skills and willingness to roll up one's sleeves to get the job done
  * Excellent written and verbal communication skills

Perks:

  * On a mission to revolutionize healthcare
  * Culture of doers
  * Venture backed, Series A equity

LendUp is a financial technology startup based in Oakland focused on transforming the subprime credit and lending space. We're a Y-Combinator alum
(YC W12) backed by prominent investors such as Google Ventures, Andreessen Horowitz, Kleiner Perkins, and Kapor Capital. Our product is being used in 7 states and we've seen great press coverage in the Wall Street Journal, Financial Times, CNN, NBC, TechCrunch, Venturebeat, Inc, Wired, Bloomberg, Fortune, and Dow Jones, amongst others.

**What we're doing:**

At LendUp we are on a mission to provide anyone with a pathway to better financial health. Millions of people don't have access to quality credit. Their options are often limited and unfair, and it's easy to become trapped in a debt cycle. This is the first problem LendUp set out to solve, by applying our combined expertise in software, data science, credit, and education, to our shared passion for financial health and dignity. We're continuing to build financial products that will help us further accelerate our mission of providing anyone with a path to better financial health.

**About the role:**

As a Product Manager, you will connect with customers to understand their needs, develop a product vision & roadmap, and champion it across the company, such that it inspires the team to go to crazy lengths to make it happen. Being a perfectionist, you will work relentlessly to improve the product to create customer delight — be it conversion, new features, user-experience or anything else that matters.

**You Must Have:**

  * An interest in the financially underserved consumer/market segment (the 40% of the US population that does not have more than $400 in savings to cover an unexpected expense) and how software could help bring dignity and delight to borrowing and improve their overall financial health.
  * A desire to own your domain end to end - from understanding the customer problem and definition of strategy to implementation via internal project team or 3rd party partnerships. Successful PMs at LendUp enjoy both strategic and tactical work.
  * An understanding that real impact requires both focus and prioritization and an innate desire to make decisions and monitor their effectiveness using data, including the ability to self-service with SQL.
  * Proven ability to connect with customers, identify unmet needs and come up with innovative ways of meeting them.
  * Proven ability to engage other stakeholders (e.g., operations, design, engineering, legal, compliance, 3rd party vendors) in achieving the best outcome and bringing to life your vision.
  * Proven record of executing on projects that move business or customer metrics.

**You Could Have** :
  * Thirst for and comfort in conversations with engineering about how the product is built at a high level.
  * 3+ years of product management experience developing and launching consumer-facing products. Startup experience is a plus.
  * Hands-on experience working with engineering teams in an Agile environment, building out a backlog, and managing a roadmap.

**We have:**

LendUp has all the things you'd expect from a mission-driven company, like a competitive salary; early stage equity; 100% company paid medical, dental and vision insurance; generous vacation/sick leave policy; 401(k).

But here's what we really love about LendUp Life:

  * We're committed to a diverse and inclusive culture that spurs innovation and creates a meaningful and impactful work environment
  * One of our values is ""different backgrounds, same mission."" We are passionate about diverse candidates and have slack channels dedicated to everything from wellness to music.

**LendUp is an Equal Opportunity Employer:**

We extend equal employment opportunities to qualified applicants and employees on an equal basis regardless of an individual's age, race, color, sex, religion, national origin, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, pregnancy status, marital status, military or veteran status, genetic disposition, or any other reason protected by law.","* ### Seniority level

when they are not working and the ones that can own outcomes.

## About HashiCorp

At HashiCorp, we value top-notch collaboration and communication skills, both among internal teams and in how we interact with our users. We take care to balance and be responsive to the needs of our open source community as well as our enterprise level customers.

Engineering at HashiCorp is largely a remote team. While prior experience working remotely isn't required, we are looking for team members who perform well given a high level of independence and autonomy.

Our Products

We build Consul, Nomad, Vault, Terraform, Vagrant, and Packer. Alongside of that, we deploy enterprise products for each in a variety of different ways: licensed and unlicensed binaries, appliances to public cloud platforms, and hosted SaaS platforms. Our products help organizations of all sizes run any infrastructure for any application.

## About The Role

Our team builds and maintains Nomad, a performant, distributed cluster orchestrator that supports heterogeneous workloads including containerized applications, VMs, batch processing, and machine learning frameworks. Jet.com, CircleCI, PagerDuty, SeatGeek, and many other large organizations run Nomad in production today.

Our customers run Nomad on tens of thousands of nodes, and rely on our tools to operate their own infrastructure and software. Our team cares deeply about reliability and performance.

## Some Of The Future Challenges For Our Team Include

  * Building an extensible plugin architecture to support and grow an ecosystem of plugins for shared concerns like runtime drivers, devices and logging.
  * Advanced scheduling use cases such as managing dependencies between tasks, oversubscription and rebalancing.
  * Service segmentation and enabling shared network namespaces among tasks.
  * Deployments across a large fleet of nodes spanning multiple regions.
  * Debugging and inspection capabilities for tasks.
  * Monitoring and predicting resource utilization.

Much of our work and libraries are open source. Nomad and its supporting libraries are written in **Go**.

## In This Role, You Can Expect To

  * Work on next-generation distributed systems for orchestration
  * Develop novel algorithms within the context of our open source tools
  * Build and architect systems for managing extremely large-scale global fleets of resources
  * Interface directly with internal teams, users and HashiCorp customers, as well as the Nomad community
  * Own the full lifecycle of feature development from design through testing and release
  * Program in Golang, learning from and contributing to a team committed to continually improving their skills

**You may be a good fit for our team if:**

  * You have a basic understanding of cluster orchestrators and schedulers (Borg, Kubernetes, Mesos etc).
  * You have experience in a lower-level language like **Go**
  * You enjoy designing systems for managing highly reliable infrastructure
  * You have experience with container technologies: CGroups, Docker, Rocket, etc.
  * You are comfortable with low-level programming, or are excited to learn.
  * You have prior experience working in high performance or distributed systems; while we strive to hire at a variety of experience levels, this particular opening is not well-suited for recent graduates
  * You are able to knowledgeably discuss design and performance tradeoffs in complex systems
  * You exhibit ownership in your work, including research and understanding of the problem space, collaborating with the team to come up with solutions, proactively communicating your progress to the team, and shipping the feature over the finish line.

**In your cover letter, please describe why you're interested in working at HashiCorp, and on the Nomad team in particular. Specifics of your past experience that are relevant to this role are great to include too.**

HashiCorp embraces diversity and equal opportunity. We are committed to building a team that represents a variety of backgrounds, perspectives, and skills. We believe the more inclusive we are, the better our company will be.","* ### Seniority level

We are building a digital-only financial hub that works to improve financial outcomes for our clients, so they can spend less time managing their money, and more time doing the things they love. We envision a future where we automatically and intelligently route a client's paycheck to take care of their day-to-day expenses, emergency fund, savings for financial goals, and long-term security. This is an audacious and inspiring vision we call Self- Driving Money™.

**Design at Wealthfront**

Unlike many companies where designers are trained to make incremental changes and work through a chain of hierarchy to advocate for bold new ideas, designers at Wealthfront are expected to be innovative, creative and strategic, because design is critical to realizing our vision. Designers are expected to define problems, new opportunities and solutions that are deeply rooted in human psychology and behavior as well as a sound understanding of our technology and business, all in very tight collaboration with engineers, product managers, researchers and data scientists. In an environment where we're making big bets, and innovation is encouraged, we embrace failure and care much more about the magnitude of success versus percentage of times we are successful. And unlike many organizations, design is an equal partner to engineering and product and plays an important role in the executive staff that collectively make all critical strategic decisions.

## About The Role

The Growth team at Wealthfront is responsible for bringing in new clients into the Wealthfront ecosystem and deepening their relationship with us through adoption of relevant financial products and services that serve their life needs.

    * Incorporate market research and user research into design solutions
    * Lead creative direction to drive user acquisitions and product adoption
    * Mentor and support other designer on the growth team

## Qualifications

Manages Release deployments (Continuous delivery and deployment)ABOUT LEGIONLegion is seeking world-class talent to help us capitalize on a massive opportunity to enable the future of work for the 2.7 billion-person strong hourly workforce. Legion powers the future of work by redefining how companies manage and empower their hourly workforces. Legions autonomous, AI-powered Workforce Management platform enables companies to tightly manage labor spend while ensuring great experiences for their employees and customers. The software accurately forecasts demand, computes precise labor needs, and staffs the right employees at the right times based on employee skills and preferences. These uncertain times also require healthy workplace features that automate the scheduling of healthy employees and offer immediate response protocols in the event symptoms are detected. These capabilities and more are already built directly into Legion.Legions modern cloud platform pairs cutting edge machine learning, artificial intelligence, and beautiful interfaces to deliver over 10x return on investment. Legion was founded by Sanish Mondkar, the former Chief Product Officer of SAP, and serves many innovative customers including Cinemark, Racetrac, Five Below, Philz Coffee, and Barry's Bootcamp. Legion has been recognized by Gartner as a Cool Vendor and was recently included on JMP Securities Hot 100 List of the Best Privately Held Software Companies. Legion is backed by preeminent venture firms such as Norwest Venture Partners, First Round Capital, Webb Investment Network, and XYZ Ventures and is based in Redwood City, California.BACKGROUND AND OPPORTUNITYThe hourly workforce currently constitutes almost 60% of the overall labor market in the United States and these nearly 80 million hourly workers are the driving force behind many of our largest domestic industries like food/beverage, retail and hospitality. Management of this workforce has historically been difficult due to high churn (average of 60%), high cost of replacement (average of $3,200 per employee in retail) and now new challenges are developing as millennials enter this market. The retail vertical alone spends $62 billion dollars a year on replacing workers and over 50% of hourly workers leave their jobs because of flexibility reasons.In our modern, Uber-ized times, younger folks seek gig- like flexibility, modern mobile first technology and compelling work options. They want to use an app on their phone to schedule work, not haggle with the manager over their schedule on a week to week basis. Likewise, employers are increasingly in need of a flexible and efficient labor model that supports the innovations (think pop up stores, home delivery, mobile ordering, service options etc) needed, and frankly demanded, by todays modern customers. Mid- market organizations have never had a technology platform to manage their hourly workers and the enterprise is mired in decades-old technology (think Kronos, Infor) thats both user-unfriendly and wildly ineffective for managing todays modern hourly workforce. There is a huge opportunity to modernize and upgrade how hourly workers interact with their employers and while enabling employers to be elastic, efficient, and innovative...but no one has cracked the code until now.","* ### Seniority level

Our mission is to make the world's health data useful so that people enjoy longer and healthier lives. We are developing tools and devices to collect, organize and activate health data, and creating interventions to prevent and manage disease.

Nearly 10% of the human population is infected with a mosquito borne-disease each year, resulting in massive mortality and enormous economic loss. We are combining modern molecular biology with robotic automation to generate millions of sterile male mosquitoes that will be released into the wild to mate with females, causing a population crash that will ultimately break disease transmission cycles.

This past summer, we ran the largest ever US field trial of sterile male releases, during which we reared and released millions of mosquitoes using our hardware and software, nearly eliminating the aedes aegypti mosquito from several neighborhoods in Fresno. Our team is responsible for building software to orchestrate and analyze the mass production and release of mosquitoes.

Our team combines expertise in biology, chemistry, physics, medicine, engineering, computer science, and more to create interventions that exponentially improve patient care. We partner with leading life sciences, medical device and government organizations to enable fast development, meaningful advances, and deployment at scale. Our work spans many projects, including Project Baseline, the quest to map human health beginning with a 10,000 person observational study; Liftware, stabilizing utensil handles to aid individuals with hand tremor or limited mobility; and Debug, an effort to reduce the threat of mosquito-borne diseases using the sterile insect technique. For more information, please visit our website.

We also employ social and gamification strategies to keep users engaged with their health and motivated to level up. Together, these tools power our lifestyle intervention programs for improved glucose regulation and metabolic health.

At January AI, we believe that every day is January 1st, that every day is a fresh start. We believe that health isn't a place you reach, but the simple process of doing just a little better than yesterday. We believe that self- improvement is a team sport. That's why January AI is creating a community of everyday people building their healthy habits, together. January AI is backed, among others, by Marc Benioff, Jerry Yang and Steve Chen, founders of Salesforce, Yahoo! and YouTube.

**Remote**

## About HashiCorp

At HashiCorp, we value top-notch collaboration and communication skills, both among internal teams and in how we interact with our users. We take care to balance and be responsive to the needs of our open source community as well as our enterprise level customers.

Engineering at HashiCorp is largely a remote team. While prior experience working remotely isn't required, we are looking for team members who perform well given a high level of independence and autonomy.

Our Products

We build Consul, Nomad, Vault, Terraform, Vagrant, and Packer. Alongside of that, we deploy enterprise products for each in a variety of different ways: licensed and unlicensed binaries, appliances to public cloud platforms, and hosted SaaS platforms. Our products help organizations of all sizes run any infrastructure for any application.

## About The Role

Our team builds and maintains Nomad, a performant, distributed cluster orchestrator that supports heterogeneous workloads including containerized applications, VMs, batch processing, and machine learning frameworks. Jet.com, CircleCI, PagerDuty, SeatGeek, and many other large organizations run Nomad in production today.

Our customers run Nomad on tens of thousands of nodes, and rely on our tools to operate their own infrastructure and software. Our team cares deeply about reliability and performance.

## Some Of The Future Challenges For Our Team Include

  * Building an extensible plugin architecture to support and grow an ecosystem of plugins for shared concerns like runtime drivers, devices and logging.
  * Advanced scheduling use cases such as managing dependencies between tasks, oversubscription and rebalancing.
  * Service segmentation and enabling shared network namespaces among tasks.
  * Deployments across a large fleet of nodes spanning multiple regions.
  * Debugging and inspection capabilities for tasks.
  * Monitoring and predicting resource utilization.

Much of our work and libraries are open source. Nomad and its supporting libraries are written in **Go**.

## In This Role, You Can Expect To

  * Work on next-generation distributed systems for orchestration
  * Develop novel algorithms within the context of our open source tools
  * Build and architect systems for managing extremely large-scale global fleets of resources
  * Interface directly with internal teams, users and HashiCorp customers, as well as the Nomad community
  * Own the full lifecycle of feature development from design through testing and release
  * Program in Golang, learning from and contributing to a team committed to continually improving their skills

**You may be a good fit for our team if:**

  * You have a basic understanding of cluster orchestrators and schedulers (Borg, Kubernetes, Mesos etc).
  * You have experience in a lower-level language like **Go**
  * You enjoy designing systems for managing highly reliable infrastructure
  * You have experience with container technologies: CGroups, Docker, Rocket, etc.
  * You are comfortable with low-level programming, or are excited to learn.
  * You have prior experience working in high performance or distributed systems; while we strive to hire at a variety of experience levels, this particular opening is not well-suited for recent graduates
  * You are able to knowledgeably discuss design and performance tradeoffs in complex systems
  * You exhibit ownership in your work, including research and understanding of the problem space, collaborating with the team to come up with solutions, proactively communicating your progress to the team, and shipping the feature over the finish line.

**In your cover letter, please describe why you're interested in working at HashiCorp, and on the Nomad team in particular. Specifics of your past experience that are relevant to this role are great to include too.**

HashiCorp embraces diversity and equal opportunity. We are committed to building a team that represents a variety of backgrounds, perspectives, and skills. We believe the more inclusive we are, the better our company will be.","* ### Seniority level

At Itility, you can advance your career as an IT professional; working on projects, Smart Factories, Smart Run, and consulting assignments onsite. An Itility team always comprises multiple competencies; ranging from project manager and scrum master to stack engineer, DevOps engineer and architect.

Our teams direct project implementation. We begin by using our own IT assessment methodology to analyze customer problems, then define the best solutions, while determining required actions.

This knowledge-intensive approach has a proven direct and positive impact on career development. With Itility, youll obtain a broad view of the IT profession; working with one customer in the implementation phase and another in the preparatory phase.

To support your development, we provide resources in the form of training, and our Itility toolkits (Ikits); including the Project Management Ikit, the Scrum Ikit, and the Smart Factory Ikit.","* ### Seniority level

We are looking for an exceptional, growth-minded Principal Visual Designer to join the QuickBooks Cash Flow team. In this role, you'll drive key, high- impact projects that aim to help small businesses prosper through thoughtful management of their cash flow.

If you're an exceptional Principal Visual Designer looking to make a difference to small businesses and ship products across mobile and web platforms, then we'd love to talk! You might be the perfect fit for the QuickBooks Cash Flow team, an awesome group of interaction, content, and visual designers doing their part to help small businesses tackle the ups and downs of cash flow.

If you've ever worked for yourself, you've no doubt spent hours with a spreadsheet or back of an envelope playing the frustrating game of managing cash flow: coordinating money coming in with money going out, knowing how much cash you actually have to spend, and scrambling to fill the gap if you're about to run out.

To run your own business is to play this game — every day. As one of our customers puts it, ""Thirty years of it and I'm still not comfortable. Everyday is a challenge."" And as research shows, most small businesses don't actually play it very well: 61% of small businesses regularly struggle with cash flow. 33% are unable to pay vendors, bills, themselves, or their employees. 82% of those that fail do so because of poor cash flow management.

The Cash Flow team's vision is to give small businesses the advantage in that cash flow game. Working with teams across all of Intuit, our designers and engineers are using machine learning and data science to create financial products and tools across banking, cards, and forecasting experiences. Our goal is to automate cash flow management so small businesses never have to worry about it.

## What You'll Bring

  * Artistry, speed, and excellence in simplifying abstract strategies and expressing concepts visually
  * Demonstrated ability to push a team's thinking through visual provocations and prototyping
  * Experience leading the end-to-end visual design for multiple platforms
  * Experience scaling existing or initiating new visual treatments, methods, systems, and illustrations that lead to emotional product experiences within the team and potentially across the organization
  * Ability to communicate a strong point of view, backed up by personal expertise, design rationale, customer data, and industry trends
  * Experience with and love of learning from customers and applying insights to generate designs that deliver customer delight
  * Ability to work on multiple projects at one time, using excellent communication skills to manage time and expectations appropriately

## How You Will Lead

  * 8+years of experience in visual design, prototyping, or related field. Some of that experience must include shipping products
  * Deep expertise and experience designing for mobile and cross-platform experiences
  * Formal training and education in Product Design, Graphic Design, Human-Computer Interaction Design, or other relevant field
  * Accomplished designer with demonstrated ability to create innovative visual designs that go beyond common deliverables
  * Deep knowledge of design principles, design heuristics, methods and best practices that provide successful & holistic end-to-end visual design across suites of products
  * Curiosity and commitment to testing new ideas and innovating to drive business results
  * Effective, articulate communicator when it comes to talking about your work with senior execs and when working through constraints with engineering partners
  * Experience mentoring and growing other designers
  * Mastery of design tools such as Sketch, Figma and InVision. Lo and hi-fidelity prototyping skills.
  * A solid online portfolio demonstrating your strong craft and collaborative process","* ### Seniority level

## Let's Talk About The Cons First

We are looking for a JAVA Lead to join our team. Like any job, it has its pros and cons.

  * We are growing fast, so you will need to keep up with the pace and hit the ground running.
  * We are a young company that gives the large AI companies a run for their money when it comes to solving enterprise automation problems. What this means for you is that you need to be prepared to deal with some of the best competitors on the planet and win. It's not necessarily a con but it can get pretty intense. Let's just say this is not a job for the faint-hearted.
  * Our team is spread across three continents-you will need to be comfortable coordinating things across US, Europe and India.

With the cons out of the way, let's talk about the good stuff.

  * We are a team of about 280+ people, so while we are young - we are not a start-up.
  * The work is challenging, and you will work directly with our management team.
  * There are three levels of people in our team - those who do the work, those who can fix things when they are not working and the ones that can own outcomes.

## What You'll Be Doing

If you have read this far, then you may want to know what background we would like our JAVA Lead to have. We have made a list, here it is:

* Primary Gatekeeper of the JAVA team
* Design Creation - High level and low level if needed
* Java Code Quality check, Code automation and Code reviews
* Ensure the deliverables are of the highest quality in terms of functional and technical aspects
* Team Mentoring and guidance at appropriate instances
* Ensure the in-sprint defects are closed with the highest quality and any production defects are being taken care of for a specific duration post release.
* Work along with the PM, Architect and the BA to manage the team and the deliverables from technical and functional aspects

## What You Should Have

  * Should have worked with and managed a team of 20-25member team at offshore and should have worked on projects where onsite-offshore coordination is required, and the delivery model is agile SCRUM for a development project
  * Must have skills - CORE Java, Spring, Spring MVC, Spring Data, Java micro-services, MYSQL/Cosmos
  * Minimum experience of 7 to 12 years

We aspire to big brand and we have put 9 years of grueling work to get to where we have reached. We are looking for someone to join us in our journey to create a company that their future generations can be proud of. As a JAVA Lead we would like you to pay attention to detail for all of our work. In fact, to validate that you are not just mass mailing your resume to every job you see, we would like you to send an email with the subject 'I am your JAVA Lead' along with your profile to shruti dot jogi at infrrd dot ai. This is our little validation trick to separate the people who apply to every job they see from people like you.

Looking forward to meeting you.","* ### Seniority level

So if you're ready to work on unrivaled technology where your desire to be part of a collaborative team is met with a laser-focused mission to stop breaches and protect people globally, let's talk.

## About The Role

This is a specialized Software Development Engineer in Test (SDET) position within the Strategic Research Initiatives (SRI) team, which works closely with the sensor engineering team to develop and release advanced product initiatives. As a key contributor to the team's focus on quality and performance of the sensor kernel components, the ideal candidate will be proficient in low-level performance profiling of kernel drivers across supported platforms and technologies. This role will also require periodic driver development in C/C++, as well as test harness and framework improvements in Python.

**Here are some typical quality-focused tasks that you will be heavily involved in:**

  * Analyze complex software features, and build effective test strategies and test design
  * Build useful tools, frameworks, and test setup to use for developing tests effectively; the goal is to minimize manual testing and for the team to write automated tests for the product
  * Identify and write specialized tests necessary that are not feature-specific but are still important to ensure the quality of the system as a whole - performance, scalability, limits etc.
  * Debug bugs found through test or customer cases to identify root cause and use the input to improve tests
  * Work collaboratively with product and release management to control risk, improve quality, and streamline our release cycles
  * Rigorous product and test code reviews with an eye towards improving the security and robustness of the system as a whole

SDETs use their strong software development skills to build effective tools, harnesses, and specialized tests to assure that quality. SDETs also participate actively in design and code reviews, and collaborate with the cloud team to assure end-to-end system functionality.

The ideal SDET candidate must have demonstrated passion to find bugs -- i.e. they must like _breaking_ software as much as writing code! They also must have demonstrated ability to write high-quality code in C or C++ and scripting languages like Python. Experience on Unix or Linux with code that has high reliability requirements; code that needs to pay attention to low-level operating characteristics (memory usage, efficient performance, correct conformance to external standards) is also highly desired.

## Required

Though the following are not all required for this position at the outset, strong SDETs in the team eventually build the following skills

  * Deeper understanding of fundamental computer science concepts; experience in analysis and implementation of data structures, algorithms, and software design
  * Ability to write and automate test cases, triage bugs, and write actionable bug reports
  * Ability to read code with a focus on its robustness and security (or lack thereof)
  * Ability to clearly define test strategies for features, and implement those strategies
  * A track record of shipping quality software

The team provides strong mentoring and management support to develop these skills while working on their core deliverables. SDETs also have the opportunity, along with SDEs, to learn more about the tools, techniques, and procedures employed in attacks on our customers and to use this knowledge in challenging the entire team to constantly improve Falcon's capabilities.

## Benefits Of Working At CrowdStrike

  * Market leader in compensation and equity awards
  * Competitive vacation policy
  * Comprehensive health benefits + 401k plan
  * Paid parental leave, including adoption
  * Flexible work environment
  * Wellness programs
  * Stocked fridges, coffee, soda, and lots of treats

We are committed to building an inclusive culture of belonging that not only embraces the diversity of our people but also reflects the diversity of the communities in which we work and the customers we serve. We know that the happiest and highest performing teams include people with diverse perspectives and ways of solving problems so we strive to attract and retain talent from all backgrounds and create workplaces where everyone feels empowered to bring their full, authentic selves to work.

We partner and embed with the customer operations team--the folks you talk to if our automation cannot solve your problem upfront--to make sure we tackle new problems as they arise. Robinhood was built from the ground up to be as efficient as possible--we are able to maintain a lean bottom-line and pass the savings along to you, the customer.

  * 5+ years of software engineering experience
  * Fluency in Javascript and Flow/Typescript
  * Understanding of functional and reactive programming paradigms
  * Great design intuition and user empathy

  * The desire to seek out the toughest technology and engineering problems and solve them with little to no guidance
  * Willingness to learn and use new technologies and touch any system to accomplish your goals
  * Extremely data-driven. You instrument and analyze everything about your systems

## Bonus Points

  * Experience working across offices and timezones
  * Experience with high-growth startups
  * Experience with Docker and Kubernetes
  * Experience with Rust or ReasonML
  * Experience with machine learning (Tensorflow, Pytorch) and big data tools (Spark, Presto, Hadoop)
  * Experience with mobile development

  * Strong open source contributions

Feeling ready to give 100% to democratizing finance for all? We'd love to have you apply, even if you feel unsure about whether you meet every single requirement in this posting.

January AI is a precision health company based in Menlo Park, Ca. Founded in 2017 by veteran Silicon Valley business executive, Noosheen Hashemi, and renowned genomicist Mike Snyder, a pioneer in bringing Big Data into personalized medicine, January AI takes a multi-omic approach to (i) understanding the physiology and psychology of the 120 million people on the diabetes spectrum and (ii) developing smart products to help them optimize their blood sugar. By harnessing science, medicine, and machine learning, our technology discovers how diabetes affects people differently and provides specific recommendations to move them to a healthier state.

While multiple technology solutions have appeared in the last decade to address diabetes, innovation has been marginal, making the sector ripe for disruption. We're leveraging dense data from wearables, smartphones, and digital health; and developed an ontology of 16M food items alongside algorithms like anti-cheat food detection, food recommendations for glycemic load, and 33-hour glucose curve predictions. We also employ social and gamification strategies to keep users engaged with their health and motivated to level up. Together, these tools power our lifestyle intervention programs for improved glucose regulation and metabolic health.

At January AI, we believe that every day is January 1st, that every day is a fresh start. We believe that health isn't a place you reach, but the simple process of doing just a little better than yesterday. We believe that self- improvement is a team sport.

Who you'll work with

You will work cross functionally with the Customer Experience, Sales, Marketing, and IT organizations, playing a leadership role in transforming Cisco by developing and implementing analytic models and intelligent automation to drive us toward a data-driven digital organization.

Digital Lifecycle Journey's (DLJ) digital expertise makes us uniquely qualified to address the evolving expectations of today's connected customers and partners, along with Cisco sellers.

Why Cisco

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here's how we do it.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we're ""old"" (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we're also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do - you can't put us in a box!

But ""Digital Transformation"" is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Don't care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That's cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!","* ### Seniority level

## Who You'll Work With

You will work cross functionally with the Customer Experience, Sales, Marketing, and IT organizations, playing a leadership role in transforming Cisco by developing and implementing analytic models and intelligent automation to drive us toward a data-driven digital organization.

**Why Cisco**

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here's how we do it.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we're ""old"" (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we're also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do - you can't put us in a box!

But ""Digital Transformation"" is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Don't care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That's cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!","* ### Seniority level

Tesla is seeking a technician to support vision systems on the Core Automation Engineering (CAE) Cell Manufacturing team and be part of a world-class team that are responsible for designing and building the automated and robotic equipment at the Tesla factories. The vision systems (smart cameras, depth sensors, etc.) are deployed in both equipment and manufacturing environments for a variety of tasks, but this role focuses on cell manufacturing quality inspections. The ideal candidate has demonstrated an interest in computer and industrial systems, especially cameras. They should also want to be on the front line of the most advanced manufacturing facilities in the world.

Daily roles and responsibilities include hands-on, lineside deployment and maintenance of the vision systems and sensor systems. While system design, code, and hardware will generally come from software and mechanical engineers, getting the systems to work, i.e., testing them and working with engineers to fix them, is the role of the technician. This includes, for example, image collection and validation of machine learning and pattern recognition models.

While Tesla has a 24-hour support team for the manufacturing line, the technician is the secondary responder and will be responsible for swiftly bring the systems back online if they fail. In other words, 24-hour on-call is not part of the role, but serious and rare failure events may lead to after- hours work.

Tesla provides training on all software required to perform the role - no prior experience with machine learning or software engineering needed, although a willingness to learn is crucial.

The key objective of the Automation team is developing new and innovative solutions in the factory and help Tesla achieve its ambitious manufacturing goals. All of these automated manufacturing processes will be planned, assembled and tested at our Tesla facilities located in Fremont, California.

## Responsibilities

  * Understand basic cell quality issues and help determine if inspecting them automatically with the vision systems is possible (after hands-on training)
  * Collaborate with relevant teams to determine optimal locations to install hardware
  * Install line-side equipment, including cameras and computer hardware
  * Wiring, networking and operating computer programs within an industrial/manufacturing environment
  * Bolting brackets, and basic hand tool usage
  * Use software to load images into a program, sort and label them and then monitor how the program labels the same images
  * Support engineers as they iterate on these systems by providing direct feedback on how the systems are functioning on the line
  * Monitor alerts and determine with available data if something is failing, and how to quickly fix it
  * Collaborate with quality engineers to communicate time periods of failure of the system

## Minimum Requirements

  * (Preferred) 1 year of experience working in an industrial or technical organization
  * Solid computer skills including specific experience with file systems and basic understanding of computer networks
  * Basic understanding of electrical safety
  * Solid written communication skills and willingness to document
  * Ability to multi-task, prioritize and work in an extremely fast-paced environment

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here's how we do it.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we're ""old"" (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we're also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do - you can't put us in a box!

But ""Digital Transformation"" is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

Open-minded, driven, diverse and very creative people at Cisco design the hardware that makes the internet work. Bring your knowledge of computers and networking and take it to a new level in any one of the following product categories including: cloud, social, mobile/wireless, video, VoIP, big data, collaboration, web, Internet of Things, routing, switching, IPv6, data center, HPC, TelePresence and many more.

Why Cisco

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here's how we do it.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we're ""old"" (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we're also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do - you can't put us in a box.

But ""Digital Transformation"" is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Don't care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That's cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!","* ### Seniority level

So if you're ready to work on unrivaled technology where your desire to be part of a collaborative team is met with a laser-focused mission to stop breaches and protect people globally, let's talk.

## About The Role

We're building a welcoming & flexible team that prizes collaboration over competition, one which provides opportunities to learn new skills, mentor junior developers and contribute to the direction of both the team & the products we're responsible for. This is a high trust environment where we allow team members to manage their own time, take holidays as they need it and reward them with competitive salaries and equity.

Our stack is Ember, but if you've used frameworks like React or Angular you're the kind of person we're looking for and we'll help get you up to speed. As we support only evergreen browsers we can push the boundaries of what's possible on the web as a platform, on top of a system that strips any hyperbole from the term ""big data"". In close collaboration with analysts & clients you'll get to see the apps & visualisations you're building used every day to hunt for hackers and protect systems.

Our ideal candidates are sensitive to the needs of the users of their software
& love learning more about their tools every day. Get excited about new features in Chrome Devtools? Tested your work in screen readers? Ever lost half an hour getting an animation's bezier curve to be just the right kind of bouncy? Looking for a challenge that's out of the ordinary? Get in touch.

The candidate will join our IT & Security Operations team to work on Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM).

CSPM is a new and complementary product area for CrowdStrike. We're extending CrowdStrike's mission of ""stopping breaches"" into the public cloud control plane and native cloud resources. CrowdStrike's CSPM offering will give customers visibility into both the (mis\) configuration and compliance of native cloud resources, and potential adversary activity involving those resources. When coupled with Falcon, CrowdStrike's endpoint security offering, our CSPM offering will provide a more comprehensive perspective on how the adversary is targeting key customer infrastructure.

## What You'll Need

  * A desire to collaborate closely with users, designers, & testers to deliver quality software that solves problems.
  * A deep understanding of Javascript and considerable experience building thick-client applications with modern frameworks such as Ember, AngularJS, Backbone or React/Flux.
  * Experience with testing frameworks, tools and methodologies such as QUnit, Mocha & Selenium.
  * Functional knowledge & interest in developing genuinely accessible interfaces.
  * Strong HTML & CSS skills, with bonus points for experience with animation, knowledge of approaches to scalable/modular CSS, & preprocessors such as SCSS & LESS.
  * Familiarity with client-side build processes & tools - Grunt, Gulp, Ember CLI etc
  * Comfortable with Git/version control workflows.

## Bonus Points Awarded For

  * Experience creating or contributing to open source projects.
  * Experience with graphics & visualisation tools such as D3 or ThreeJS.
  * Interest & experience with design & data visualisation.
  * Experience with coaxing that last frame-per-second out of browsers.

Why Cisco

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here's how we do it.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we're ""old"" (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we're also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do - you can't put us in a box.

But ""Digital Transformation"" is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

**Why Cisco**

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here's how we do it.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we're ""old"" (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we're also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do - you can't put us in a box!

But ""Digital Transformation"" is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Don't care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That's cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!","* ### Seniority level

Cisco is looking for a hardworking Senior Analyst Relations Manager to develop and lead the global analyst relations program for Cloud Strategies.

  * Provide ongoing analyst feedback and competitive information with key internal partners to ensure data is integrated into product strategy, narratives and marketing materials
  * Collaborate with Product Marketing to support marketing campaigns

## Who You'll Work With

This is a very important position that will have an immediate positive impact and effectively propel Cisco forward with positive perception in the marketplace and an in-depth view of our competitors with regard to positioning, pricing, expansion activity, product offerings and SWOT.

You will report to the Director of Analyst Relations for Network Infrastructure and partner closely with other key members of the AR team, Communication, across relevant business specialists across the company.

## Who You Are

You are a self-starter who has successfully built and developed strong, impactful analyst relations programs before.

## You Have

You have a proven track record of crafting and executing a successful AR program strategy and building collaborative relationships with influential analysts, executive spokespeople, communications, product strategy, and marketing leaders.

  * Proven self-motivated, results oriented teammate with proven negotiation skills
  * Experience collaborating cross-functionally and across global geographies with remote colleagues and stakeholders

**We Are Cisco**

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here's how we do it.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we're ""old"" (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we're also a software company. And a security company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do - you can't put us in a box!

But ""Digital Transformation"" is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Don't care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That's cool.","* ### Seniority level

****Why Cisco****

WE ARE CISCO

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here's how we do it.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we're ""old"" (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we're also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do - you can't put us in a box!

But ""Digital Transformation"" is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

Cisco will consider for employment, on a case by case basis, qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records.

**We Are Cisco**

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here's how we do it.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we're ""old"" (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we're also a software company. And a security company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do - you can't put us in a box!

But ""Digital Transformation"" is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Don't care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That's cool.
